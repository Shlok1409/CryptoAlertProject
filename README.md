# Generic Crypto-Portfolio

## General idea

A web application that would allow users to store, modify and observe their cryptocurrency portfolio. Users have the opportunity to add the assets to their portfolios and are provided with useful information about them, how the prices change, which ones are, profitable and which are not. The website is supposed to aid them in their investment and make managing their holding easier by storing all information in one place. <br><br>
Another feature, aimed mostly at people who just begin investing in cryptocurrencies is price prediction. Using machine learning, the website is supposed to predict how the price will change in the following days, aiding less experienced or indecisive users with help on what might be worth investing
into.
